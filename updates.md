## 🛡️ Role & Admin System

- **Standardized `roles` field** in `userModel.js`:

## 📰 Patch Notes System

- Patches stored in DB with:

  - `version`, `title`, `content`, timestamps

- Admins can:

  - Create new patches
  - Edit or delete existing ones

- **Live preview appears on public Updates page coming next**

---
